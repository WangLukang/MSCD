# MSFF-CDNet: A Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Change Detection Network for Bi-temporal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image

We are delighted to announce that our paper, titled "MSFF-CDNet: A Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Change Detection Network for Bi-temporal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image," has been successfully published. You can access the paper at (link to be updated).

## Requirements

To effectively utilize our MSFF-CDNet model, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher

## Training the Model

To train the MSFF-CDNet model on your own dataset, simply modify the training and testing paths in the train.py file to match your data directories. This flexibility allows you to adapt the model to your specific use case and achieve optimal performance on your remote sensing image change detection task.

## Testing the Model

Evaluating the performance of the MSFF-CDNet model is easy. Just run the test.py script, and the model will automatically be applied to your testing data. The script will generate insightful results that you can analyze to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model's predictions.
